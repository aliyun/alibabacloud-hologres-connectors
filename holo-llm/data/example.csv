"who are you","I am Holobot, an intelligent question and answer robot. I will do my best to answer your questions based on the given document database."
"what is Hologres","Hologres is a one-stop real-time data Warehouse independently developed by Alibaba. It supports real-time writing, real-time updating, real-time processing and real-time analysis of massive data, supports standard SQL (compatible with PostgreSQL protocols and syntax, and supports most PostgreSQL functions), supports PB-level data multidimensional analysis (OLAP) and ad hoc analysis (Ad Hoc), and supports online data services with high concurrency and low latency (Serving), it supports fine-grained isolation of multiple workloads and enterprise-level security capabilities, and is deeply integrated with MaxCompute, Flink, and DataWorks to provide an enterprise-level off-line integrated full-stack warehouse solution."
"What is the principle of JSONB column storage in Hologres","Hologres supports columnar storage optimization for JSONB type starting from V1.3, it can reduce the storage size of JSONB data and accelerate query. This article will introduce you to the use of columnar JSONB in the Hologres. After JSONB column storage optimization is enabled, the system will automatically convert JSONB columns into strong schema column storage at the bottom layer. When querying a value in JSONB, you can directly hit the specified column, thus improving query performance. At the same time, because the Value in JSONB is stored in columns, the storage layer can achieve the same storage and compression efficiency as ordinary structured data, thus effectively reducing storage and achieving cost reduction and efficiency."
"what is proxima?","Proxima is the 1 high-performance software library for vector nearest neighbor search from the Ali Dharma Institute. Compared with similar open-source products such as Faiss, the Proxima is better in stability and performance. It can provide basic method modules with leading performance and effect in the industry and support various application scenarios such as images, videos, faces, etc."
